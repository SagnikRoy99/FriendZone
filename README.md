# FriendZone
I developed "FriendZone" a Social Media Website where Users can Upload images,status and chat with their friends,using PHP,HTML,CSS,JavaScript.
Open up XAMPP Control Panel and start "Apache" and "MySQL",Go to "localhost/phpmyadmin/" and import "friendzone.sql" as a new database,Now open up "ht docs" in your "xampp" folder and paste all the files present here within a single file "FriendZone",After pasting it into "ht docs" you can open up your browser and type "localhost/FriendZone"to see the project.
